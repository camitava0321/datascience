Marriott as an event organiser offers services to provide well-executed events that attract \
guests and corporate clients. In any event we provide all our hotel facilities and services, \
for example different types of rooms in attractive rates, banquet catering service, \
non-catering services like pad and paper, overhead projector, sound system, microphones, \
standees, banners, airport or station drop and pickup etc. We also arrange rooms and hotel \
services in other hotels in the vicinity for guests participating in bigger events \
involving large number of people. We organise events that spans multiple cities. \
In such case we also assist in booking hotel services in other non-group hotels. \
For an event, we offer the complete service involving even arrangement of flowers, decoration.\
Event organiser will even be able to use our special services towards specially abled \
participants. But for a very small event, say less than 4 people, our services might become too costly for a customer. \
There will be a dedicated Event Manager from Marriott who will be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing various events, conferences, and functions. Event Managers ensure seamless coordination between clients, hotel staff, and vendors, ensuring successful and memorable events. Their expertise in logistics, budget management, and attention to detail contributes to the overall success and reputation of our hotel.  \
