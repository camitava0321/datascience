# Codebasics Q&A: Question and Answer System Based on Google Palm LLM and Langchain for E-learning company  

This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a Q&A system for an e-learning company called codebasics (website: codebasics.io). Codebasics sells data related courses and bootcamps. They have thousands of learners who uses discord server or email to ask questions. This system will provide a streamlit based user interface for students where they can ask questions and get answers.

- Their human staff will use this file to assist their course learners.
- We will build an LLM based question and answer system that can reduce the workload of their human staff.
- Students should be able to use this system to ask questions directly and get answers within seconds

## You will learn following,
  - Langchain + Google Palm: LLM based Q&A
  - Streamlit: UI
  - Huggingface instructor embeddings: Text embeddings
  - FAISS: Vector databse
