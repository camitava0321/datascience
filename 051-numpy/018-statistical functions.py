import numpy as np 
#NumPy has quite a few useful statistical functions for 
#finding minimum, maximum, percentile standard deviation and variance, etc. from the given elements in the array. 

#numpy.amin() and numpy.amax()
#These functions return the minimum and the maximum from the elements in the given array along the specified axis.

#The numpy.ptp() function returns the range (maximum-minimum) of values along an axis.

#numpy.percentile(a, q, axis)
#Percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. The function numpy.percentile() takes the following arguments.
#Sr.No. 	Argument & Description
#1 	
a
Input array
#2 	
q
The percentile to compute must be between 0-100
#3 	
axis
The axis along which the percentile is to be calculated

#Median is defined as the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. The numpy.median() function is used as shown in the following program.

#Arithmetic mean is the sum of elements along an axis divided by the number of elements. The numpy.mean() function returns the arithmetic mean of elements in the array. If the axis is mentioned, it is calculated along it.

#numpy.average()
#Weighted average is an average resulting from the multiplication of each component by a factor reflecting its importance. The numpy.average() function computes the weighted average of elements in an array according to their respective weight given in another array. The function can have an axis parameter. If the axis is not specified, the array is flattened.
#Considering an array [1,2,3,4] and corresponding weights [4,3,2,1], the weighted average is calculated by adding the product of the corresponding elements and dividing the sum by the sum of weights.
#Weighted average = (1*4+2*3+3*2+4*1)/(4+3+2+1)

#Standard Deviation
#Standard deviation is the square root of the average of squared deviations from mean. The formula for standard deviation is as follows âˆ’
#std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))
#If the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], then its mean is 2.5. Hence the squared deviations are [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25] and the square root of its mean divided by 4, i.e., sqrt (5/4) is 1.1180339887498949.
print np.std([1,2,3,4])

#Variance
#Variance is the average of squared deviations, i.e., mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2). In other words, the standard deviation is the square root of variance.
print np.var([1,2,3,4])
