#Shape of an Array
#ndarray.shape - returns a tuple consisting of array dimensions. It can also be used to resize the array.
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])

#These numbers denote the lengths of the corresponding array dimension. 

#The "shape" of an array is a tuple with the number of elements per axis (dimension).

#Numbering of axis
#The shape of an array tells us also something about the order in which the 
#indices are processed, i.e. first rows, then columns and after that the further dimensions.

#"shape" can also be used to change the shape of an array.
# this resizes the ndarray

#or
x.shape = (2, 9)

#The new shape must correspond to the number of elements of the array, 
#i.e. the total size of the new array must be the same as the old one. 
#We will raise an exception, if this is not the case:
x.shape = (4, 4)
#The above code will result in an error

#further examples.
#The shape of a scalar is an empty tuple:

#dtype of array is int8 (1 byte)

#numpy.flags - The ndarray object has the following attributes. Its current values are returned by this function.
#Sr.No. 	Attribute & Description
#1 	   C_CONTIGUOUS (C)     The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment
#2 	   F_CONTIGUOUS (F)     The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment
#3 	   OWNDATA (O)          The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another object
#4 	   WRITEABLE (W)        The data area can be written to. Setting this to False locks the data, making it read-only
#5 	   ALIGNED (A)          The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the hardware
#6 	   UPDATEIFCOPY (U)     This array is a copy of some other array. When this array is deallocated, the base array will be updated with the contents of this array

#The following example shows the current values of flags.
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
