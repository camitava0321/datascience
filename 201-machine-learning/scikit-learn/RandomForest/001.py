# Basic - is that you have data, fit it to an estimator, then predict
#Step 1: Initialise an estimator

#%% - Transformers and pre-processors
#Machine learning workflows are often composed of different parts. 
#A typical pipeline consists of a pre-processing step that transforms or imputes the data, 
#and a final predictor that predicts target values.

#In scikit-learn, pre-processors and transformers follow the same API as the estimator objects 
#(they actually all inherit from the same BaseEstimator class). 
#The transformer objects donâ€™t have a predict method but rather a transform method 
#that outputs a newly transformed sample matrix X:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
# scale data according to computed scaling values
scaledX = StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X)
print (scaledX)
# Sometimes, you want to apply different transformations to different features: 
#the ColumnTransformer is designed for these use-cases
clf.fit(X, y)
print (clf.predict(X))  # predict classes of the training data
print (clf.predict(testX2))  # predict classes of the training data
