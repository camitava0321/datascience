#For Loop
for letter in 'Python':     # First Example

#Iterating by Sequence Index
#An alternative way of iterating through each item is by index offset into the sequence itself. Following is a simple example âˆ’
for index in range(len(fruits)):
   print 'Current fruit :', fruits[index]
   
#Using else Statement with Loops
for num in range(10,20):  #to iterate between 10 to 20
  if num%3 == 0:      #to determine if divisible by 3
     print '%d is divisible by 3' % num
  else:                  # else part of the loop
     print num, '%d is NOT divisible by 3' % num
